This project is a clone of Newsweek webpage in the HTML/CSS module at Microverse
It consists of building a responsive website using Bootstrap. We cloned The Newsweek home page with a responsive layout that changes at three breakpoints.

We worked on all the requirements given on this project, and it consits of the following components:

- breakpoints at three screen widths:
    - < 768px
    - > 768px and < 992px
    - > 992px
- Header section with fixed layout when scrolling starts
- Featured stories, Top stories and The debate section laid out into a three column bootstrap layout,
  which also collapse into two column layout and one column layout at the 2nd and 1st breakpoints respectively.
- In The Magazine section with four column bootstrap layout, which collapses into a single column layout for <768px breakpoint.
- Editors pick section with four column bootstrap layout, which collapses into two column layout and one column layout at the 2nd and 1st breakpoints    respectively.
- Other news section with three column layout, which collapses into a single layout for <768px breakpoint.
- Subscribe section with two column bootstrap layout, which collapses into a single layout for <768px breakpoint.
